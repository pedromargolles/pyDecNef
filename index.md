## About

The pyDecNef library provides a complete framework for performing real-time fMRI decoded neurofeedback studies in an open programming language like Python.

From the creation of the working space, through the scripts for building the decoder and fMRI volumes pre-processing, to the scripts for neurofeedback training and data post-processing. 

In addition, introductory tutorials on the neurofeedback decoding technique and advanced use of the pyDecNef pipeline are provided.

Although this library, as it is, is oriented to the development of classical decoded neurofeedback studies, it can be easily customized for the execution of other types of real-time brain-computer interface studies.

For example, GLM experiments, adaptive experimental designs where experimental conditions are modified based on brain activation patterns, optimization and calibration designs, encoding and signal reconstruction paradigms...

To access this framework scripts visit its [Github repository](https://github.com/pedromargolles/pyDecNef).
