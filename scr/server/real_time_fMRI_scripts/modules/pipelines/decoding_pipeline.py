    """ 
    Average volumes within a trial HRF peak before decoding a single averaged volume to increase signal-to-noise ratio

    Steps:

        1 - Load model
        2 - Average volumes of interest (i.e., volumes within HRF peak) onto a single volume
        3 - Predict class probabilities over this trial averaged volume
        4 - Get probability of decoding ground truth class

    Inputs:

        preproc_vols: masked and preprocessed volumes (List of Numpy arrays. Each array has following dimensions: 1, n_voxels)
        model_file: pretrained model (ex., a classifier) in a Region Of Interest (Have to match with mask_file)
        ground_truth: as integer. Target class position in model probabilities predictions tuple.
